      summary: An empty POST request is used to create a new upload resource. The
        Upload-Length header indicates the size of the entire upload in bytes.
        If the Creation With Upload extension is available, the Client MAY include 
        parts of the upload in the initial Creation request
      description: Endpoint for the Creation extension. Modified by the Creation With
        Upload extension.

      - name: Upload-Metadata
        in: header
        description: Added by the Creation extension. The Upload-Metadata request
          and response header MUST consist of one or more comma-separated key-value
          pairs. The key and value MUST be separated by a space. The key MUST NOT
          contain spaces and commas and MUST NOT be empty. The key SHOULD be ASCII
          encoded and the value MUST be Base64 encoded. All keys MUST be unique. The
          value MAY be empty. In these cases, the space, which would normally separate
          the key and the value, MAY be left out. Since metadata can contain arbitrary
          binary values, Servers SHOULD carefully validate metadata values or sanitize
          them before using them as header values to avoid header smuggling.

          and response header MUST be set in both partial and final upload creation
          requests. It indicates whether the upload is either a partial or final upload.
          If the upload is a partial one, the header value MUST be partial. In the
          case of a final upload, its value MUST be final followed by a semicolon
          and a space-separated list of partial upload URLs that will be concatenated.
          The partial uploads URLs MAY be absolute or relative and MUST NOT contain
          spaces as defined in RFC 3986.

                indicates the time after which the unfinished upload expires. A Server
                MAY wish to remove incomplete uploads after a given period of time
                to prevent abandoned uploads from taking up extra storage. The Client
                SHOULD use this header to determine if an upload is still valid before
                attempting to resume the upload. This header MUST be included in every
                PATCH response if the upload is going to expire. If the expiration
                is known at the creation, the Upload-Expires header MUST be included
                in the response to the initial POST request. Its value MAY change
                over time. If a Client does attempt to resume an upload which has
                since been removed by the Server, the Server SHOULD respond with the
                404 Not Found or 410 Gone status. The latter one SHOULD be used if
                the Server is keeping track of expired uploads. In both cases the
                Client SHOULD start a new upload. The value of the Upload-Expires
                header MUST be in RFC 7231 datetime format.
