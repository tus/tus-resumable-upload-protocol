The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## Status

This protocol is under development and is not ready for general adoption yet.

The goal is to have a 1.0 release candidate in a few weeks, at which point only
minor revisions will be made to the protocol. After a few months 1.0 will be
frozen, and changes will be considered very carefully. Ideally there will be no
need for a version 2.0.

## Contributing

This protocol is authored and owned by the tus community. We welcome patches
and feedback via
[Github](https://github.com/tus/tus-resumable-upload-protocol). All contributors
will be listed as authors.

Please also let us know about any implementations (open source or commercial)
if you'd like to be listed on the
[implementations](http://www.tus.io/implementations.html) page.

## Abstract

The protocol provides a mechanism for resumable file uploads via HTTP 1.1 ([RFC
2616](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616)).

## Notation

Characters enclosed by square brackets indicate a placeholder (e.g. `[size]`).

## Core Protocol

The core protocol describes how to resume an interrupted upload. It assumes that
you already have a URL for the upload, usually created via the [File
Creation](#file-creation) extension.

All clients and servers MUST implement the core protocol.

### Example

A HEAD request is used to determine the offset at which the upload should be
continued.

The example below shows the continuation of a 100 byte upload that was
interrupted after 70 bytes were transfered.

**Request:**

```
HEAD /files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216 HTTP/1.1
Host: tus.example.org
```

**Response:**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Offset: 70
```

Given the offset, the client uses the PATCH method to resume the upload:


**Request:**

```
PATCH /files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216 HTTP/1.1
Host: tus.example.org
Content-Type: application/offset+octet-stream
Content-Length: 30
Offset: 70

[remaining 30 bytes]
```

**Response:**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
```

### Headers

#### Offset

The `Offset` header is a request and response header that indicates a byte
offset within a resource. The value MUST be an integer that is `0` or larger.

### Requests

#### HEAD

Servers MUST always return an `Offset` header for `HEAD` requests against a tus
resource, even if it is `0`, or the upload is already considered completed.
If the tus resource is not found Servers MUST return either `404` or `403` 
without `Offset` Header.

#### PATCH

Servers MUST accept `PATCH` requests against any tus resource and apply the
bytes contained in the message at the given `Offset`. All `PATCH` requests
MUST use `Content-Type: application/offset+octet-stream`.

The `Offset` value SHOULD be equal, but MAY also be smaller than the current
offset of the resource, and servers MUST handle `PATCH` operations containing
the same data at the same absolute offsets idempotently. The behavior of using
`Offset` values larger than the current upload offset is undefined, see the
[Parallel Chunks](#parallel-chunks) extension.

Clients SHOULD send all remaining bytes of a resource in a single `PATCH`
request, but MAY also use multiple small requests for scenarios where this is
desirable (e.g. NGINX buffering requests before they reach their backend).

Servers MUST acknowledge successful `PATCH` operations using a `200 Ok` status,
which implicitly means that clients can assume that the new `Offset` = `Offset`
\+ `Content-Length`.

Both clients and servers SHOULD attempt to detect and handle network errors
predictably. They may do so by checking for read/write socket errors, as well
as setting read/write timeouts. Both clients and servers SHOULD use a 30 second
timeout. A timeout SHOULD be handled by closing the underlaying connection.

Servers SHOULD always attempt to process partial message bodies in order to
store as much of the received data as possible.

Clients SHOULD use a randomized exponential back off strategy after
encountering a network error or receiving a `500 Internal Server Error`. It is
up to the client to decide to give up at some point.

## Protocol Extensions

Clients and servers are encouraged to implement as many of the extensions
described below as possible. There is no feature detection for clients, instead
they should allow individual extensions to be enabled/disabled in order to
match the available server features.

### File Creation

All clients and servers SHOULD implement the file creation API. In cases where
that does not make sense, a custom mechanism may be used instead.

#### Example

An empty POST request is used to create a new upload resource. The
`Entity-Length` header indicates the size of the file that will be uploaded.

**Request:**

```
POST /files HTTP/1.1
Host: tus.example.org
Content-Length: 0
Entity-Length: 100
```

**Response:**

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: http://tus.example.org/files/24e533e02ec3bc40c387f1a0e460e216
```

The new resource has an implicit offset of `0` allowing the client to use the
core protocol for performing the actual upload.

#### Headers

##### Entity-Length

The `Entity-Length` header indicates the final size of a new entity in bytes.
This way a server will implicitly know when a file has completed uploading. The
value MUST be a non-negative integer.

#### Requests

##### POST

Clients MUST use a `POST` against a well known file creation url to request the
creation of a new file resource. The request MUST include a `Entity-Length`
header.

Servers MUST acknowledge a successful file creation request with a `201
Created` response code and include an absolute url for the created resource in
the `Location` header.

Clients then continue to perform the actual upload of the file using the core
protocol.

### Checksums

This extension will define how to provide per file or per chunk checksums for
uploaded files.

### Parallel Chunks

This extension will define how to upload several chunks of a file in parallel in
order to overcome the throughput limitations of individual tcp connections.

### Metadata

This extension will define how to provide meta information when uploading files.

### Streams

This extension will define how to upload finite streams of data that have an
unknown length at the beginning of the upload.

### Retries

In the case of the server not being able to accept the current request it MAY
return `503 Service Unavailable`. The client SHOULD retry the request after
waiting an appropriated duration. It MAY retry for other status codes including
`4xx` and `5xx`.

## FAQ

### Why is the protocol using custom headers?

We have carefully investigated the use of existing headers such as `Range` and
`Content-Range`, but unfortunately they are defined in a way that makes them
unsuitable for resumable file uploads.

We also considered using existing `PATCH` payload formats such as
[multipart/byteranges](http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-httpbis-p5-range-latest.html#internet.media.type.multipart.byteranges),
but unfortunately the XHR2 [FormData
interface](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#interface-formdata) does not
support custom headers for multipart parts, and the [send()
method](http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#the-send-method) does not allow
streaming arbitrary data without loading all of it into memory.

That being said, custom headers also allowed us to greatly simplify the
implementation requirements for clients and servers, so we're quite happy with
them.

### Why are you not using the "X-" prefix for your headers?

The "X-" prefix for headers has been deprecated, see [RFC
6648](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6648).

### How can I deal with bad http proxies?

If you are dealing with http proxies that strip/modify http headers or can't
handle `PATCH` requests properly, you should consider using https which will
make it impossible for proxies to modify your requests.

If that is not an option for you, please reach out to us, we are open to
defining a compatibility protocol extension.

### How are pause/resume handled? When should I delete partial uploads?

Needs to be written ...
